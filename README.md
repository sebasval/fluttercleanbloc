# flutter_clean_architecture

A flutter project using clean architecture

## Getting Started


Inspiration for using this:

We know that the bad code slow us down, why we write bad code? The 
answer is i have to go faster (you don't go faster writing crappy), 
if you wanna go fast do a good job. 


How this work:

Layers

Widget -> View Presentation (bloc,vm,presenter ...) -> useCase 
-> repository -> dataSources -> (remote/local)
